    "pointing to the vernal equinox. For all intensive purposes, this frame is a\n",
    "true inertial (no moving) reference frame. In reality, our solar system is \n",

    "z-axis is the mean spin axis of the planet, positive to the north, and the\n",
    "y-axis completes the right-hand system. This frame rotates with motion of\n",
    "the Earth and therefore is constantly changing relative to the ECI frame.\n",

    "The LGV frame creates a local frame with the z-axis parallel to the local\n",
    "gravity vector. Now, the x-axis and y-axis can be oriented several different\n",
    "ways. A common aerospace frame is North (x), East(y), Down(z) or NED. This\n",
    "orientation has the characteristic of altitude above the ground being\n",
    "negative. Another option is North (x), West (y), Up (z) or NWU which now has\n",
    "the local z-axis opposite gravity and up being positive. The reference below\n",
    "also show a link to the European Space Agency (ESA) and gives a more complex\n",
    "way to have a local frame with East (x), North (y), Up (z) or ENU.\n",
