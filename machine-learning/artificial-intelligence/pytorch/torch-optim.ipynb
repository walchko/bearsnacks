    "| Negative Log Likelihood | `NLLLoss` | The negative log likelihood loss is useful to train a classification problem with C classes. Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by adding a LogSoftmax layer in the last layer of your network. You may use CrossEntropyLoss instead, if you prefer not to add an extra layer. |\n",
