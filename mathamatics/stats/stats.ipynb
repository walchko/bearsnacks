    "\n",
    "The predicted value of a variable, calculated as the sum of all possible\n",
    "values ($x_i$) each multiplied by the probability ($p_i$) of its\n",

    "\n",
    "Variance describes how far a set of numbers are spread out from each\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For random variables which show similar behavior the sign of the cov is\n",
    "positive. If the random variables act differently, then the sign is\n",
    "negative. The magnitude is hard to interpret unless the cov is\n",

    "## Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",

    "*Population*. The default is that this is a sample of a much larger\n",
    "distribution, so this is just 6 samples. When this is just a sample set,\n",
