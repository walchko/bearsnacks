    "Denavit Hartenberg (DH) is an attempt to standardize how we represent serial manipulators (i.e., robot arms). It is typically one of the first ways you learn. It is really easy (methodical) to do forward kinematics, but becomes more challenging when doing inverse kinematics. Here we are going to introduce what is goning on, but you need to focus on the DH process. If you follow the process, then all will work out fine. Don't get too hung up on the begining math, understand the concepts so you can follow the DH process.\n",
